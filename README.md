## Installation

1. Clone the repository through **Github Desktop** or do the *git clone* bash command in a terminal 
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/HieuNGN/DictApp4Everyone.git
```
2. Navigate to the directory of your cloned version, open the project in an IDE like **IntelliJ Community/Ultimate** or if you're a pro, use **Eclipse** 
3. Navigate again to the *Application* class under the *src* folder and run it, the app window should pop up just fine (seriously, if it doesn't run, we'll probably bite the dirt)  
## Special Thanks
Without the help of our dear and beloved friend TuML, this project wouldn't be what it is today, so huge shout out to him and we'll probably buy him a beer or two in the next few days
