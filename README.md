## Guide 

1. Clone the repo through the Github Desktop Application or simply run the git clone command in a terminal, works like a charm on every OS. 
2. Fire up IntelliJ IDEA Community/Ultimate or if you're a pro, use Eclipse to run the app. 
3. Bare with us since this is still very rudimental and the UI is somewhat stupid.
